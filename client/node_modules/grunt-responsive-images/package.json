  "readme": "# grunt-responsive-images [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-responsive-images.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-responsive-images)\n\n> Produces images at different sizes\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-responsive-images --save-dev\n```\n\nYou'll also need to install Imagemagick CLI Tools.\n\n```shell\nbrew install ImageMagick\n```\n\nOnce both the plugin and ImageMagick have been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-responsive-images');\n```\n\n## The \"responsive_images\" task\n\n### Overview\n\nThe responsive_images task will take your source image and create images at different resolutions for use with [PictureFill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) or with [srcset](https://github.com/borismus/srcset-polyfill).\n\nA demo of both srcset and PictureFill using Grunt Responsive Images [is available here](http://andismith.github.io/grunt-responsive-images/).\n\nSome slides about the plugin are [available here](http://slid.es/andismith/grunt-responsive-images).\n\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `responsive_images` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  responsive_images: {\n    options: {\n      // Task-specific options go here.\n    },\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.sizes\nType: `Array`\n\nDefault value:\n\n```js\n[{\n  name: \"small\",\n  width: 320,\n  height: 240,\n  quality: 1\n},{\n  name: \"medium\",\n  width: 640,\n  height: 480,\n  quality: 1\n},{\n  name: \"large\",\n  width: 1024,\n  height: 768,\n  quality: 1\n}]\n```\n\nAn array of objects containing the sizes we want to resize our image to.\n\nIf both width and height are specified, then the image will be resized and cropped.\n\nIf a `name` is specified, then the file will be suffixed with this name. e.g. my-image-small.jpg\n\nIf a `name` is not specified, then the file will be suffixed with the width and/or height. e.g. my-image-320x240.jpg\n\nUse `suffix` for retina graphic filenames. e.g. my-image-320x240_x2.jpg\n\nUse `quality` to change the quality of an image (0.1, 0.2 ... 0.9, 1).\n\n#### options.separator\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `-`\n\nThe character used to separate the image filename from the size name.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n#### Default Options\nUsing the default options will produce 3 responsive images - one at 320px wide, one at 640px wide and one at 1024px wide.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  responsive_images: {\n    myTask: {\n      options: {},\n      files: {\n        'dest/mario-yoshi.jpg': 'test/assets/mario-yoshi.jpg'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Custom Options\nIn this example, we specify our own image sizes, including a retina graphic. We also specify our files with a wildcard.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  responsive_images: {\n    myTask: {\n      options: {\n        sizes: [{\n          width: 320,\n          height: 240\n        },{\n          name: 'large',\n          width: 640\n        },{\n          name: \"large\",\n          width: 1024,\n          suffix: \"_x2\",\n          quality: 0.6\n        }]\n      },\n      files: [{\n        expand: true,\n        src: ['assets/**.{jpg,gif,png}'],\n        cwd: 'test/',\n        dest: 'tmp/'\n      }]\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n#### Custom Destination\nIf you would like to output each image size to a different directory, you can do so with custom_dest. For example:\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  responsive_images: {\n    myTask: {\n      options: {\n        sizes: [{\n          width: 320,\n        },{\n          width: 640,\n        },{\n          width: 1024,\n        }]\n      },\n      files: [{\n        expand: true,\n        src: ['**.{jpg,gif,png}'],\n        cwd: 'test/assets/custom_dest/',\n        custom_dest: 'tmp/custom_dest/{%= width %}/'\n      }]\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can use `{%= width %}`, `{%= height %}`, `{%= name %}` or `{%= path %}` as a delimiter.\n\nPlease note that `{%= width %}`, `{%= height %}` and `{%= name %}` are only available if they are set in the object literal that you use to set each generated size option.\n\nThe `{%= path %}` value contains additional directory structure from the current working directory (cwd in files array) to each image.  Using `{%= path %}` allows any complex directory structure to persist into the rendered responsive images directory.\n\nNOTE: for grunt-responsive-images to pick up images within subdirectories you must set your files.src property to `**/*.{jpg,gif,png}`.\n\n## As Seen On...\n\nThe following sites and libraries are using Grunt Responsive Images (because they ROCK!):\n\n* [BBC-News/Imager.js](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/)\n* [yeoman/generator-mobile](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mobile)\n\nAnd the inspiration for [grunt-responsive-videos](https://github.com/sjwilliams/grunt-responsive-videos).\n\nPlease let us know if your live site or library uses Grunt Responsive Images. We'll add our favorites.\n\n## FAQ\n\n* *Receiving a `fatal error: spawn ENOENT`* - Ensure Imagemagick CLI tools are installed. Try uninstalling and reinstalling them if you are having issues.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n\n*0.0.6*\n\n* Added path value to custom_dest to allow for persistent directory structures (thanks to [maslen](https://github.com/maslen))\n* Started list of sites using Grunt Responsive Images plugin (contact [@andismith](http://www.twitter.com/andismith) to add yours)\n\n*0.0.5*\n\n* Fixed issue with custom_dest names including a prefixed separator.\n* Fixed issue with tallies including a prefixed separator.\n\n*0.0.4*\n\n* Fixed issue with quality setting not producing correct quality output.
